**Last Updated: October 14, 2025**

**CLASS ACTION WAIVER NOTICE: BY ACCESSING OR USING THE PORTAL SOFTWARE OR THE REALITY NETWORK, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AGAINST RULE 110, INC. OR ITS AFFILIATES. ALL DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY, AS DETAILED IN SECTION 11. THIS WAIVER AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS—READ SECTION 11 CAREFULLY. YOU MAY OPT OUT AS DESCRIBED THEREIN.**

## 1. INTRODUCTION & ACCEPTANCE 
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING, DOWNLOADING, OR USING THE PORTAL SOFTWARE (THE “SOFTWARE”) OR PARTICIPATING IN ANY WAY IN THE REALITY NETWORK (THE “NETWORK”), INCLUDING ON MOBILE DEVICES OR VIA PARTNERSHIPS.  

These Terms of Use, including our Privacy Policy [insert link] and any documents or policies referenced herein (collectively, the “Terms”), form a legally binding agreement between you (“User,” “you”) and Rule 110, Inc. (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), including any future affiliates, foundations, DAOs, or offshore entities involved in Network operations (e.g., token generation events or governance) regarding the Software and your interactions with the Network (the “Agreement”). By clicking “I Agree,” or by accessing or using any part of the Software or the Network, you affirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with all of these Terms, you must not access or use the Software or the Network.  

### 1.1 Key Highlights 
Arbitration & Class Action Waiver: Section 11 contains a binding arbitration provision and CLASS ACTION WAIVER that affects your legal rights. You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days as described in Section 11.3.
Protocol Code License: The Protocol Code is made available under the Apache License 2.0; these Terms supplement (but do not override) those open-source rights. Portal Software is proprietary.  
Experimental & Decentralized: The Reality Network is experimental, decentralized, and not fully controlled by Rule 110, Inc. We operate some Nodes (“Controlled Nodes”), but the majority of Nodes are run by independent third parties. You assume significant risks, including token volatility, forks, hacks, exploits, and regulatory uncertainties.  
Non-Custodial / No Accounts: We do not provide user “accounts;” you access the Network via cryptographic keypairs (similar to other blockchain wallets). You are solely responsible for managing your private keys.  
Liability Limit: Our liability is strictly limited to the maximum extent permitted by law (Section 9). You assume all risk of use.  
No Guarantee of Tokens or Profit: $NET is a utility token with no guaranteed value, nor is it represented as an investment.  
Hardware and Mobile Risks: Running nodes on consumer hardware (e.g., phones, laptops, Raspberry Pi, VPS) may cause overheating, battery drain, performance degradation, increased energy costs, or hardware failure. Mobile use may violate app store policies or incur data charges; you assume all risks.  
Staking and $NET: $NET is staked for Network participation (e.g., node throttling, rApp deployment); no guarantees of rewards, value, or redemption (including testnet to mainnet ratios). Staking involves slashing risks for downtime, negligence or malice.  
Tax Implications: Earnings from $NET (e.g., staking rewards) may be taxable; consult tax advisors.  
Future Entities: These Terms apply to interactions with any future Company affiliates, foundations, DAOs, or offshore entities.  
If you are uncertain about your legal obligations or potential risks, consult a legal professional before using the Software or participating in the Network.  

## 2. DEFINITIONS  
“Company” or “Rule 110, Inc.”: The Delaware corporation that develops and maintains the Portal Software.  
“Portal Software” or “Software”: The proprietary node application (and related interfaces, libraries, SDKs or APIs) provided by Rule 110, Inc., enabling Users to run nodes, host decentralized applications, and interact with the Reality Network.  
“Reality Network” or “Network”: A decentralized blockchain-based ecosystem using a 2MEME consensus protocol (Proof of Useful Work) for peer-to-peer computing, token issuance, rApp deployment, governance, and cross-chain bridging.  
“rApps” or “Reality Applications”: Third-party, decentralized applications that run on the Network (hosted or transmitted by Node Operators).  
“$NET”: The Network’s native utility token, which may be earned or used within the Network’s protocols. Rule 110, Inc. does not control the issuance, value, or distribution of $NET beyond providing open-source Software and encoding the programmatic issuance schedule in the protocol.  
“User” or “you”: Any individual or entity who uses, downloads, or accesses the Software or interacts in any way with the Network.  
“Node Operator”: A User who runs the Software (or a compatible fork) to validate the Network state, store data, host rApps, or provide computing resources on the Network.  
“Contributions”: Any code, documentation, or other materials you make available or submit to Rule 110, Inc. or its repositories for the purpose of improving or modifying the Portal Software or the Network.  
“Agreement”: These Terms, plus any referenced documents (e.g., Privacy Policy).  
"Staking" or "Stake": The commitment of $NET tokens to participate in the Network, enabling node selection (e.g., into Bucket A or B) and throughput allocation, as governed by 2MEME consensus. Stakes are reusable but subject to slashing.  
"Slashing": Automatic reduction or loss of staked $NET for node failures (e.g., downtime, invalid proposals, sybil behavior).  
"Bucket A" and "Bucket B": Node selection partitions under 2MEME, where Bucket A holds at least 50% of total staked $NET, and Bucket B the remainder.  
"Proof of Useful Work": The Network's computational tasks (e.g., entropy minimization via random walks on data graphs) performed by nodes.  
"Swaps" (Cross-Chain): Third-party or decentralized mechanisms for asset exchanges, not traditional bridges, involving trust assumptions.  
"Protocol Code": The open-source consensus and protocol logic (e.g., 2MEME) available on GitHub under the Apache License 2.0, distinct from the proprietary Portal Software. Forks refer to modifications of the Protocol Code.

## 4. PORTAL SOFTWARE & LICENSE  
4.1 License Applicability  
The Portal Software is provided under a proprietary End-User License Agreement (EULA). This means:  
You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Software solely for personal, non-commercial purposes to interact with the Network. You may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer, or create derivative works from the Portal Software without our express written consent.  
In contrast, the Protocol Code is provided under the Apache License 2.0, allowing use, modification, and distribution subject to its terms (e.g., including copyright and patent notices, and attribution in NOTICE files). Attribution is required in all forks or derivatives of the Protocol Code as specified in the license.  
Any forked or modified versions of the Protocol Code you create, access, or engage with are your sole responsibility. Rule 110, Inc. does not guarantee compatibility, security, or functionality of modified Protocol Code.  
These Terms supplement the Apache License 2.0 for Protocol Code by governing your relationship with Rule 110, Inc. (e.g., disclaimers, liability limits). In any conflict, the Apache License 2.0 controls regarding Protocol Code usage rights. These prohibitions apply to your use of the Network and Portal Software but do not limit rights granted under the Apache License 2.0 for the Protocol Code.  

4.2 Software Updates & Forks  
You acknowledge and agree that the Software and the Network protocols may be updated, forked, or discontinued at any time:  
Updates: We may release patches or new versions to address bugs, security vulnerabilities, or protocol changes. You are responsible for upgrading to maintain compatibility.  
Forks: The Network may experience chain splits or protocol divergences, resulting in multiple versions or networks. Forks refer exclusively to the Protocol Code; the Portal Software is proprietary and may not be forked. Rule 110, Inc. is not responsible for any losses arising from forks or your decision to follow (or not follow) any particular fork.  

4.3 Contributor License  
If you contribute code, documentation, or other materials (“Contributions”) to Rule 110, Inc.’s repositories (e.g., via GitHub pull requests), you:  
Grant Rule 110, Inc. and the community a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, transferrable, sub-licensable and irrevocable license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, and create derivative works from those Contributions under the Apache License 2.0 (or similarly permissive terms) for Protocol Code, or under proprietary terms for Portal Software contributions (accepted on a case-by-case basis via CLA).  
Represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to make such Contributions, and that your Contributions do not infringe any third-party IP.  
By submitting Contributions, you agree to our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) see Appendix A, granting us rights under the Apache License 2.0 and requiring you to certify no IP infringement.  

4.4 No Warranty or Guarantee To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Software is provided “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, and “AS AVAILABLE.” This includes disclaimers of implied warranties (merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement). You assume all risks associated with running open-source, blockchain-based software.  

## 5. REALITY NETWORK PARTICIPATION  
5.1 Autonomous, Decentralized Protocols The Reality Network operates via decentralized peer-to-peer protocols that are not fully controlled by Rule 110, Inc. While Rule 110, Inc. develops and maintains the Portal Software and the Network, we only control certain Nodes (“Controlled Nodes”). Independent third-party Node Operators run the majority of Nodes, and the Network’s governance, token issuance, and rApps function autonomously. Any data processed or stored by Nodes outside our control is subject to those Operators’ practices and configurations, over which we have no authority. Please carefully read the terms and conditions associated with any rApp before interacting with it. 

5.2 $NET Token  
No Guarantee: Rule 110, Inc. does not guarantee the value, availability, or issuance of $NET. All aspects of $NET (e.g., supply, distribution, consensus rewards) are governed by the Network’s decentralized protocols, which may change over time.  
Not an Investment: $NET is intended as a utility and/or governance token, not a security or investment contract. We do not represent that $NET is free from regulatory scrutiny; it may be deemed a security under certain jurisdictions’ laws. You are solely responsible for compliance with securities or other regulatory requirements if applicable.  
$NET is earned via staking rewards (modeled on Bitcoin halvings, capped at 1 billion tokens) and rApp distributions; no inflation/deflation beyond protocol schedule. Staking does not guarantee profits and involves risks like slashing for poor performance.  
rApps may distribute their own tokens or rewards to hosting nodes; Rule 110, Inc. has no role or responsibility in such distributions, valuations, regulatory compliance, or any associated risks.  

5.3 Node Operation & Resource Usage  
Hosting rApps: Node Operators may host third-party rApps, which can consume bandwidth, CPU, storage, or other resources. You acknowledge that hosting rApps may impose significant resource usage and costs.  
Monitoring & Allocation: You are responsible for monitoring resource consumption (CPU, memory, bandwidth, storage) to avoid disruptions or conflicts with other system processes.  
Hardware & System Impact: Prolonged node operation may cause increased wear on your hardware. Rule 110, Inc. is not liable for any hardware damage, performance degradation, or costs due to resource usage.  
Hardware Risks: Operation on consumer devices (e.g., phones, laptops, Raspberry Pi) may cause overheating, battery drain, increased wear, energy costs, or failure. Minimum specs required; failure to meet may result in slashing.  
Mobile-Specific Risks: Battery depletion, data charges, app store rejections, or compatibility issues; no support guaranteed.  
Legal Liability: You may face liability for hosting illegal rApps or content; perform due diligence.  
Port Forwarding Risks: Setting up port forwarding to connect to the Network may expose your device to security vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access, DDoS attacks, or malware. You are solely responsible for securing your network and assume all related risks.  
Experimental Consensus Risks: The 2MEME consensus is experimental; accidental slashing may occur due to bugs, network issues, or unintended behavior. We disclaim all responsibility for such losses.  
Environmental Impact: Node operations may contribute to energy consumption and carbon emissions; you assume responsibility for any environmental or sustainability implications.  

5.4 Third-Party rApps & Content  
No Endorsement or Control: rApps are created and maintained by third parties. Rule 110, Inc. does not audit, monitor, or endorse rApps and disclaims liability for any losses or damages arising from them.  
Security & Compliance: By interacting with or hosting rApps, you assume the risk that they may contain vulnerabilities, malicious code, or other legal/compliance issues. You must perform your own due diligence.  
License Grant from rApp Developers: By deploying or uploading an rApp to the Network, the developer grants each Node Operator and Rule 110, Inc. a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to copy, store, transmit, and display the rApp’s code and content solely for the purpose of enabling normal operation of the Network and rApp accessibility.  
Prohibited Reverse Engineering and Tampering: You agree that you will not, and will not assist, encourage, or enable others to: a) Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code, underlying algorithms, or structure of any rApp deployed or hosted on the Reality Network, except to the extent expressly permitted by the rApp’s license. b) Modify, tamper with, circumvent, or attempt to bypass any security measures, access controls, or usage restrictions embedded in any rApp. c) Use any automated tools, scripts, or software to scan, analyze, or extract proprietary components from any rApp without the explicit authorization of the rApp’s developer. d) Reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works based on an rApp in a manner that violates the rApp’s licensing terms or applicable laws. Violation of this provision may result in termination of your ability to participate in the Network and may subject you to legal action by the rApp’s developer or other rights holders.  
Trademark Usage: If an rApp uses trademarks, names, or logos, the rApp developer represents it has rights to those marks and grants Rule 110, Inc. the limited right to reference or display them in the Portal Software’s interface or listings, without implying endorsement.  
Third-Party Tokens/Rewards: Some rApps may distribute their own tokens or rewards. Rule 110, Inc. has no role or responsibility in such distributions, valuations, or regulatory compliance.  
Take-Down: While the Network is decentralized and we do not generally monitor rApps, Rule 110, Inc. may block references to or remove rApp listings in the Portal interface if we become aware of illegal or infringing content, at our sole discretion.  
rApp builders must agree to separate terms [insert link], granting Node Operators a license to host while prohibiting reverse engineering of closed rApps. Open-source rApps follow their licenses; closed rApps may include protections against decompilation. No Company curation or endorsement.  
We are not responsible for rApps, their content, security, or any rewards (e.g., third-party tokens) they provide to hosting nodes. No endorsement or liability assumed.  

## 6. USER CONTENT & HOSTING POLICY  
6.1 User-Generated Content Except for rApps (Section 5.4), you may post or submit text, images, or other content (“User Content”) in connection with the Software or community forums (if any). You retain ownership of your User Content, but grant Rule 110, Inc. a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to display and distribute such content as needed to operate or improve the Software or Network.  
6.2 Content Violations We do not generally monitor or censor User Content, but we may, at our discretion:  
Remove or disable any User Content we believe violates these Terms, infringes IP rights, or is unlawful.  
Terminate or suspend the hosting or availability of such content without notice if we deem it necessary to comply with the law or protect the interests of Users.  
6.3 Legal Compliance Users are solely responsible for ensuring that any content (including rApps) they submit or host via the Network does not violate local or international laws (e.g., export controls, data privacy).  
You acknowledge that arbitrary data embedded in transactions (e.g., memos) becomes immutable and public; avoid PII as hashing/ZKPs do not guarantee unlinkability from individuals.  

## 7. CROSS-CHAIN BRIDGING & INTEROPERABILITY  
7.1 Swaps Disclaimer The Network may facilitate "swaps" (cross-chain exchanges) via rApps. You acknowledge:  
Third-Party Protocols: Swaps typically involve third-party smart contracts or protocols outside Rule 110, Inc.’s control. We disclaim liability for hacks, vulnerabilities, or failures in these third-party systems.  
Loss Risks: Assets locked or transferred via a swap may become permanently unrecoverable if the swap is compromised, ceases operation, or becomes incompatible.  
No Guarantee: We do not guarantee any swap functionality will remain available, secure, or functional over time.  
Some involve trust assumptions (e.g., counterparties); use at your risk.  
7.2 Your Responsibility You are solely responsible for assessing the risks and exercising caution before using swaps or interacting with any external blockchains or tokens. Rule 110, Inc. is not liable for losses, delays, or technical failures arising from swap activities.

## 8. DISCLAIMERS & ASSUMPTION OF RISK  
8.1 Experimental Technology The Portal Software and the Reality Network are experimental. By using or running the Software, you acknowledge:  
Bugs & Vulnerabilities: The Network may have undiscovered vulnerabilities or design flaws that could result in significant losses.  
Forks & Volatility: Forks may occur, tokens can lose value, and the protocol may change without notice.  
No Fiduciary Duty: Rule 110, Inc. does not act as your fiduciary or advisor. All decisions are at your own risk.  
8.2 Non-Custodial & No Money Services  
No User Accounts: We do not provide centralized user accounts; access is via cryptographic keypairs (like MetaMask). You control your private keys and are solely responsible for securing them.  
Not a Money Transmitter: Rule 110, Inc. does not hold, exchange, or transmit your digital assets. We are not a bank, exchange, broker, custodian, or money services business.  
No Financial Advice: Nothing in these Terms, on our website, or in the Software is intended to be investment, legal, or tax advice. You should consult professional advisors for guidance.  
8.3 Regulatory Uncertainty Blockchain technology and digital assets face evolving regulatory scrutiny. You assume all risks related to possible future legal or regulatory actions impacting your use of $NET or the Network. Rule 110, Inc. disclaims any liability for losses or disruptions caused by changes in law, regulatory enforcement, or classification of tokens.  
8.4 Third-Party Liability Rule 110, Inc. is not liable for any content, code, or transactions you undertake with third parties (including other Users, rApp developers, or swap protocols). Your recourse for disputes or losses caused by third parties is solely against those third parties.  
8.5 On-Chain Data & Limited Storage You acknowledge that the Network primarily records account balances, wallet addresses, computer code, and other transaction metadata. Rule 110, Inc. strongly discourages embedding personal or sensitive data on-chain. If you or a third party nevertheless place personal data in a transaction, it may become permanently and publicly accessible among all Network nodes, including nodes not controlled by Rule 110, Inc. We disclaim responsibility for any personal or confidential information that becomes visible on the ledger, as we cannot remove or alter on-chain data once recorded.  
Staking/Slashing Risks: Loss of $NET via slashing for failures; no recovery.  
Consensus Risks: 2MEME may fail under extreme sybil attacks (>80%); no guarantees of fault tolerance.  
Testnet Risks: No guaranteed redemption ratio for testnet $NET to mainnet.  
Accidental Slashing and Experimental Risks: Due to the experimental nature of the Protocol Code and Network, staking may result in accidental slashing or token loss from bugs, forks, or unforeseen issues. No guarantees or recovery provided.

[ ] I HAVE READ AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS

# REALITY NETWORK – PRIVACY POLICY  
**Last Updated: October 14, 2025**  

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is incorporated by reference into the Reality Network Terms of Use (“TOU”). All capitalized terms used here but not defined have the meanings set forth in the TOU. In the event of any conflict between this Policy and the TOU, the TOU controls.  

## 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Purpose This Policy explains how Rule 110, Inc. (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, shares, and protects personal data in connection with the “Reality Network,” the “Portal Software,” the “SDK,” and the “APIs” (collectively, the “Services”).  
1.2 Our Role in the Network Rule 110, Inc. builds and maintains the protocol code for the Reality Network and operates some nodes on the Network (“Controlled Nodes”). However, the vast majority of Reality Network nodes are operated by independent third parties (“Independent Operators”) over whom we have no control. By participating in the Network or using our Services, you acknowledge that data managed by Independent Operators (or placed on-chain by you or others) lies beyond our oversight and control. Please read this Policy carefully to understand what data we handle, and what remains outside our responsibility.  

## 2. SCOPE & APPLICABILITY  
2.1 Data Under Our Control This Policy applies to personal data that Rule 110, Inc. directly collects and processes, such as:  
Data stored or processed by the Portal Software (including basic logs or analytics).  
Data collected via our Controlled Nodes (the subset of nodes we run).  
Information you provide directly to us (e.g., support requests, newsletter sign-ups).  
2.2 Data Outside Our Control Many Reality Network nodes are beyond our control, and participants may deploy rApps, store data off-chain, or broadcast transactions. We do not control how Independent Operators configure their nodes, use logs, or store rApp data. We disclaim liability for data handling on nodes we do not operate. Further, the Reality Network’s blockchain may record account balances and wallet addresses (and possibly other data if participants embed it). Once such data is on-chain, it is immutable and generally viewable by participants or block explorers.  
2.3 Incorporation by Reference All disclaimers, liability limitations, and relevant definitions in the TOU apply to this Policy. By using the Services, you consent to our collection and processing of personal data in accordance with this Policy. If you do not agree, discontinue use immediately.  

## 3. DATA WE COLLECT  
3.1 Data You Provide Voluntarily We may collect personal data (such as your name or email address) if you:  
Contact Us for Support: Submitting a message through our help desk or emailing us.  
Opt In for Updates: Signing up for newsletters or product announcements.  
Participate in Feedback or Beta Programs: Offering suggestions or bug reports.  
Community feedback, surveys, or analytics opt-ins.  
3.2 Technical & Usage Data When you interact with the Portal Software, SDK, or APIs, we may automatically collect:  
IP addresses, device/browser types, logs and analytics, timestamps, and pages accessed for security and troubleshooting.  
Cookies or similar technologies (where lawful) to manage session state or gather aggregated analytics. We do not use these for targeted advertising nor do we sell your data.  
Aggregated analytics for Network improvements (e.g., resource usage patterns).  
3.3 Data Collected by Our Controlled Nodes Our Controlled Nodes may store additional logs about consensus participation, resource usage, or node performance. This can include IP addresses of peers, timestamps of connections, or certain transaction metadata (e.g., wallet addresses engaging with that node). We do not, however, intentionally store on-chain data in a human-readable format. Where feasible, personal data is hashed or otherwise obfuscated. Nevertheless, any data that is broadcast to the Reality Network’s ledger may be accessible to all nodes in the Network.  

## 4. DATA ON THE REALITY NETWORK  
4.1 Account Balances & Wallet Addresses The Reality Network ledger primarily records:  
Account/wallet addresses: Typically strings used to identify participants.  
Account balances: E.g., token amounts tied to a given wallet address.  
These addresses and balances are viewable by any participant or third party monitoring the blockchain (e.g., via an explorer). If an address can be linked to your identity, it may be considered personal data under regulations like GDPR or CCPA.  
4.2 Hashing & Zero-Knowledge Proofs The Network uses hashing and/or zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to verify the integrity of data and computations without revealing the underlying data in plaintext.  
Hashing: Transforms data into a fixed “fingerprint” to confirm authenticity, while making reversal of the original data highly improbable.  
ZKPs: Permit one party to prove a statement (e.g., a valid transaction) without disclosing confidential details.  
Caution: While these cryptographic techniques enhance privacy, they do not prevent you or third parties from placing other data on-chain. If personal data is embedded on-chain in any form, it may be replicated irreversibly.  
4.3 No Guaranteed Absence of Personal Data Although the Network is designed to store only balances, addresses, and cryptographic verifications, users (or rApps) could still embed arbitrary data in a transaction. We strongly discourage inserting personal identifiers or sensitive content on-chain. Once on-chain, it cannot be deleted or altered by any single party.  
4.4 Liability Disclaimer Beyond the Controlled Nodes, we do not control Independent Operators, rApps, or how they handle logs or data. We disclaim liability for any personal information that becomes visible or stored on-chain. You assume full responsibility for any data you choose to broadcast on the Network, as stated in the TOU.  

## 5. HOW WE USE & SHARE DATA WE CONTROL  
5.1 Service Provision & Improvements We use the data we collect—like IP logs, device info, or feedback—to operate, maintain, and improve the Network, the Portal Software, SDKs, and APIs. For instance, logs help us debug errors or optimize system performance.  
Using analytics/feedback for community engagement and enhancements.  
5.2 Communications If you provide contact details (e.g., email), we may send:  
Service Updates: Notices about key changes to the Portal or protocol.  
Security Alerts: Critical advisories if we suspect unauthorized activity.  
Newsletters (Opt-In): Marketing or product updates, which you can unsubscribe from at any time.  
5.3 Legal Requirements & Security We may disclose personal data if required by law (e.g., a lawful subpoena) or if necessary to:  
Enforce our agreements or investigate potential violations of the TOU or this Policy.  
Detect or prevent security incidents, fraud, or other malicious activities.  
Protect the rights, property, or safety of our users, staff, or the public.  
5.4 Service Providers We may engage third-party vendors for hosting, analytics, or communications. These providers process personal data only on our behalf and under strict confidentiality obligations. We do not sell or rent personal data to third parties.  

## 6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS & NODE LOCATIONS  
6.1 Data Transfers Rule 110, Inc. may store or process personal data on servers located in various jurisdictions. Where required by law, we apply standard contractual clauses or other approved safeguards for international data transfers.  
6.2 Global Distribution in the Reality Network Any data placed on-chain can be copied to nodes worldwide. Even data within our Controlled Nodes may be transmitted among Independent Operators as part of consensus or transaction propagation. Once broadcast, it may be out of our practical reach for modification or deletion.  

## 7. DATA SECURITY  
7.1 Measures Taken We implement industry-standard security measures—such as encryption in transit, limited staff access, and routine audits—to protect personal data on our own systems and Controlled Nodes.  
7.2 User Responsibilities You are responsible for:  
Safeguarding your wallet keys, account credentials, or tokens.  
Verifying any rApp or Node Operator’s reputation before sending sensitive info.  
Complying with the TOU and refraining from embedding personal data on-chain.  
7.3 No Absolute Guarantee Although we strive to protect data under our control, no security system is infallible, and data on the Reality Network is inherently decentralized. Any data breach or misuse by Independent Operators is outside our direct control.  

## 8. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY  
8.1 Not Directed to Minors As stated in the TOU, our Services are not intended for individuals under the age specified by law (e.g., under 16 or 13, depending on jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors. If we discover we have unintentionally collected such data, we will delete it from our own systems. However, we cannot remove anything already placed on the blockchain.  

## 9. YOUR RIGHTS & CHOICES  
9.1 Data Subject Rights Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights such as:  
Access & Correction: Requesting a copy of or corrections to your personal data.  
Deletion: Asking us to remove your personal data from our systems.  
Objection / Restriction: Restricting certain processing where lawful.  
Portability: Obtaining a machine-readable copy of data you provided.  
To exercise these rights for data we control, contact us per Section 12.  
9.2 Limitations in a Decentralized Context If personal data is on-chain or stored by Independent Operators, we cannot delete or alter it. The Reality Network is immutable, and we lack authority over third-party nodes or rApps.  
9.3 CCPA & ‘Do Not Sell’ For California residents, we do not “sell” personal data as defined by the CCPA. You may contact us regarding any other CCPA rights (like requests to know or delete), and we will address them consistent with the limitations above.  
9.4 GDPR & Lawful Bases For EU/EEA/UK residents, we rely on contractual necessity, legitimate interests, or consent (where required) to process personal data. We practice data minimization and strive to ensure no personal data is placed on-chain except for pseudonymous references (like wallet addresses). We will respond to GDPR requests within legal deadlines but may be limited by the blockchain’s immutability.  

## 10. DISCLAIMER & LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  
10.1 Nodes Outside Our Control We do not warrant or represent that Independent Operators or rApps will follow any particular privacy practices. By using the Reality Network, you acknowledge that any data stored on nodes we do not control is beyond our oversight. Consequently, we disclaim liability for the privacy, security, or retention of such data, as further detailed in the TOU.  
10.2 On-Chain Immutability Any personal data broadcast on-chain may be permanently replicated in the ledger. We cannot promise compliance with data erasure requests if the data was placed on-chain.  
10.3 Assumption of Risk You assume all risk for interactions with the Reality Network, including any potential correlation of your wallet address with your identity, or misuse by third parties of data that you or others publish on-chain.  

## 11. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY  
We may periodically update this Policy to reflect new practices, legal requirements, or technical changes. The “Last Updated” date at the top indicates when revisions were made. If we make substantial changes, we may notify you via the Portal Software or another method. Your continued use of the Services after any revised Policy becomes effective signifies your acceptance of those changes.  

## 12. CONTACT US  
If you have questions, requests, or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or your personal data, please reach out to:  
Email: info@realitynet.xyz  
Mail: Rule 110, Inc. – Brian O’Beirne Privacy Officer 
We will make reasonable efforts to address your inquiry in a timely manner. For more details on disclaimers, liability limitations, and your responsibilities, please see the TOU. If you do not accept our data practices or disclaimers, your sole recourse is to cease using the Services and avoid interacting with the Reality Network.
